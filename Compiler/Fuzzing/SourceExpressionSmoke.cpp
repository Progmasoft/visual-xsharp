// The executable regressions of two of the three large tables: every program
// of the expression and leaving tables runs through CorePrep, Xpp, Xmm, LLVM
// and the ORC JIT, unoptimized and optimized, and must return its expected
// value from both. The branching table is `source_execution_smoke`.
//
// The three tables were one program. Every run of a body passes its inputs
// as calls, so that no stage can fold them, and since arguments are passed by
// need each such argument is a suspended computation with code of its own.
// The programs grew with that, and under the sanitizers the one program ran
// past its process watchdog with every case passing. A watchdog is meant to
// end a run that never finishes, not to bound the size of a test table, so
// the tables are two programs and the watchdog is what it was.
