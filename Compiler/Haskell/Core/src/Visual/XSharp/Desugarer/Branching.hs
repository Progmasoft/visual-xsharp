{- | Lowering of value blocks and of @match@ to Core statements.

Core has no block expression and no match. Both lower to the pair that every
storing expression lowers to: statements that run first, and a store-free
expression for the value. A match becomes a chain of 'CoreIf' statements that
test the arms in order, so exactly one body runs and no Core expression, wire
format, or later stage changes.

The lowering of the expressions and blocks inside these forms belongs to the
main desugarer, which passes it in through 'BranchLowering'.

Such an expression has no Core value, so none is made up for it: there is no
result slot, no placeholder and nothing for a join to read. The operands
that are evaluated before the one that never completes are evaluated for
their effects, in order; the operands after it are never reached and are not
lowered. A choice every branch of which leaves is a conditional statement
over the statements of its branches.

{- | Lower a @match@.

The subjects are evaluated once, left to right, and each is bound to a local
so that every arm tests the same values. The names the arms bind are bound
next, each to its subject: binding a scalar that was already evaluated has no
effect of its own, and no arm can see a name of another arm. The arms then
form one chain of conditionals, each arm in the false branch of the one
before it. That is the shape of an @else if@ chain, which every stage walks
in a loop, so the lowering of a match is as deep as one arm whatever the
number of arms.

A match whose type is @void@ is the statement form: its arm bodies run for
their effects and its value is the unit literal. Otherwise every arm that
completes stores its value into a result slot, and an arm whose block leaves
stores nothing. The type checker guarantees that the slot is assigned on
every path that reaches its read, because some arm always accepts.

An arm that always accepts ends the chain with its body; the type checker
has rejected any arm after it. A guard is the last operand of the arm's
test, behind the short-circuit conjunction, so it runs only when the
patterns accept. Only a guard that stores into a local needs statements of
its own; they go before the conditional of its arm, inside the false branch
of the arm before it, and that arm alone adds a level of nesting.
