{- | What the lowering needs to know to evaluate a value by need.

Visual X# is a lazy language: a value is computed when it is first needed and
at most once, and a value that is never needed is never computed. Its effects
are not lazy: a store into a variable and a transfer of control happen where
they are written. The source has no notation for either fact; the compiler
tells the two kinds of expression apart.

This module holds that distinction for the initializer of a local binding.
An initializer may be deferred when evaluating it later gives what evaluating
it now would give: it stores nothing, transfers nowhere, and reads the
variables it names as they are where the binding stands. Deferring it is
observable only when it might fail or never return, so only then is it worth
a flag and a test at every use.

{- | Whether evaluating an expression at a later point of the same function
gives the value that evaluating it in place would give, provided the
variables it reads still have the values they had.

That holds for expressions built from names, literals, operators, tests and
calls: a call cannot store into a local of its caller. It does not hold for
an expression that stores, that leaves, or that contains statements.

{- | Whether the statement that follows a binding is certain to read it.

A value that is certain to be needed by the very next statement may be
computed where its binding stands: nothing can be observed between the two
places except which of two computations fails first when both fail. That
saves the flag and the test for the common case of a value that is used at
once.

The next statement reads the name for certain when the expression it
evaluates first always reads it. A binding evaluates its initializer first
only when it is itself evaluated in place, which the second argument
decides for it from the statements after it.
