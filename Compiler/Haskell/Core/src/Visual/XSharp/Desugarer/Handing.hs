{- | What the lowering needs to know to hand a value on by need.

An argument is a value like any other: it is computed when the method that
receives it first needs it, at most once, and not at all when the method
never needs it. A value that is computed where it stands needs nothing for
that. A value by need that one function hands to another needs a place both
can reach: the caller may need it too, and whoever needs it first computes
it for both. That place is a callable that remembers its result, a
/suspended computation/; see 'Visual.XSharp.Core.CoreMemoize'.

This module holds the two analyses that decide where suspended computations
are used. Both read the typed tree and neither changes it.

* 'methodNeeds' finds the parameters a method may leave unused: those are
  passed by need. A parameter the method is certain to read first of all is
  passed as a value, which costs nothing and can be told apart from passing
  it by need only by which of two failures a caller meets.

* 'handedLocals' finds the locals of a function whose values may be handed
  on by need. Such a local is suspended in a callable of its own instead of
  in a flag and a slot of the frame, because a frame cannot be reached from
  another function.

{- | Which parameters of which methods are passed by need.

A parameter is passed by need when its type can be suspended, as the given
predicate decides, and the method is not certain to need it before anything
else that can be observed; see 'neededFirst'. Computing such an argument at
the call then differs from computing it where the method needs it in
nothing but the place.

Whether a statement reads a parameter depends on the methods it calls: a
call does not read an argument it passes by need. The answer therefore
starts from every parameter of a suspendable type being passed by need,
under which a call reads the fewest arguments, and is computed again from
its own result until it no longer changes. Each round can only find more
parameters that are certain to be read, so the rounds end.

{- | Whether the first thing a body does that can be observed needs the given
parameter.

The statements are followed in order for as long as nothing they do can be
observed. A binding whose initializer has no effect computes nothing where
it stands: it is passed over, and when its value always needs the parameter
its name is remembered, because a later need of that name is a need of the
parameter. A statement that evaluates an expression which can neither fail
nor run without end is passed over as well. The answer is found at the
first statement that needs the parameter or one of the remembered names,
and it is no at the first statement that could do anything else: fail,
never return, choose a path or leave.

A parameter this holds for may be computed at the call. A caller can tell
only which of two failures it meets when the argument and the statement
that needs it both fail, and the language leaves that open.

The result may name locals that turn out to be computed where they stand;
for those it has no consequence.
