{- | Pure building blocks for lowering expressions that store into locals.

Core expressions never write a local: only 'CoreAssign' and 'CoreBind'
statements do, and every Core optimization relies on that. A source
expression such as @a = b@, @a += b@ or @a++@ therefore lowers to a pair: the
statements that perform its stores, and a store-free expression that reads
the result. This module holds the rules for combining such pairs without
changing what the source observes:

* an operand evaluated before a later store must not see that store;
* an operand that is evaluated lazily keeps its stores lazy;
* a loop condition that stores does so on every test of the condition.

{- | Statements that must run before an expression, and the expression.

The statements are in execution order. The expression contains no store; it
is valid only after the statements have run, and it stays valid until one of
the locals it reads is assigned again.
-}
type Lowered = ([CoreStatement], CoreExpression)

{- | Every local that the statements may assign, at any nesting depth.

Bindings are not listed: a binding introduces a fresh symbol, which no
earlier expression can have read. Closure bodies are not entered either. A
closure captures by value when it is created, so a store inside its body
changes the closure's own copy and not the local of the enclosing function.

{- | Whether an already evaluated operand still has its value after statements
that assign the given locals have run.

A literal always does. A plain read of a local does unless that local is
assigned. Anything else is a computation whose evaluation order relative to
the later statements is observable, through a call, a trap or a read, so it
does not survive and must be bound first.

moves to the top of the body, where its statements run before every test,
including the test that follows @continue@.

The update clause stays in the loop's update position, so @continue@ still
runs the update and then the condition statements.

{- | A @do@/@while@ loop whose condition has statements of its own.

The body runs once before the first test, and @continue@ must reach the
test. Both hold when the test sits at the top of an unconditional loop and
is skipped on the first pass only, which the given fresh flag records.
