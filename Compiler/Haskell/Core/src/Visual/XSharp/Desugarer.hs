{- | Bind a local whose value is computed by need.

The binding computes nothing. It declares the local, a flag that says the
value has not been computed, and a copy of each variable the initializer
reads that is assigned somewhere in the function: the initializer means the
values those variables have here, whenever it is evaluated. The first read
of the local that is reached computes the value and sets the flag, and no
later read computes it again; see the lowering of a name.

{- | Lower a @while@ or @for@ loop whose body and condition store break
values into the given target. Loops nested in the body are statements of
their own and are lowered without a target.

A @break@ in the condition leaves the loop. The statements of a condition
that has any stand at the top of the Core loop body, so the Core @break@
there leaves the right loop without further work.

A @continue@ in the condition abandons the rest of the condition and
evaluates the condition again; in a @for@ loop the update clause does not
run. In a @while@ loop the condition stands at the top of the Core loop
body, where the Core @continue@ does exactly that. In a @for@ loop the Core
@continue@ would run the update, so a condition that holds a @continue@ is
evaluated in a loop of its own, which the @continue@ repeats and which is
left once the condition has a result. A @break@ in such a condition leaves
that inner loop with the result still false, which leaves the @for@.

A @continue@ in the update clause ends the update, and the condition is
tested next. Core has no such transfer inside an update region, so an update
clause that holds one is wrapped in a loop that runs once: its statements,
then a @break@. The @continue@ becomes a @break@ of that loop.

A @break@ in the update clause leaves the loop, which the Core @break@ in an
update region does. In an update clause that is wrapped, it first sets a
flag that is bound before the loop, and the loop is left after the wrapper
when the flag is set.
