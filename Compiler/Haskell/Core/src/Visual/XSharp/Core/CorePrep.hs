{- | Lower statements into blocks, ending the last open block with the given
terminator and placing the given blocks after the ones produced.

Both arguments exist so that the work is linear in the size of the body. A
branch or a loop body falls through to a known block; passing that jump down
ends the region with it directly, where patching the blocks afterwards would
visit every block of a nested region once per enclosing region. The blocks
that follow are passed in so that they are consed onto, where appending them
would copy the blocks of a nested region once per enclosing region; an
@else if@ chain is such a nest, one level per link.

Only the last block of a region can be left open: a @return@, @break@ or
@continue@ closes its block and drops the statements after it, and every
nested region is closed by its own terminator.

{- | Lower a conditional expression to a two-way branch over a result slot.

Exactly one arm is evaluated. The slot is bound before the branch with the
neutral literal of its type and each arm overwrites it on its own path, so
the join block reads an initialized value from either predecessor without a
phi node. The neutral value is never observable: no path reaches the join
without passing through one of the two assignments.
