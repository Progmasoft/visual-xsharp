Semantic reachability for members of one template declaration.

Template specialization is lazy at member granularity.  A request for one
member must nevertheless retain every same-declaration member reached by a
resolved call from its body.  The call graph is keyed by @SymbolId@, never by
spelling: overloads can share a source name while remaining distinct semantic
definitions.

Calls whose target is not a direct member of the declaration are deliberately
classified as external.  This module does not guess inheritance, extension,
dynamic dispatch, or another declaration's ownership from a name.  Those
decisions belong to name and call resolution before specialization.
