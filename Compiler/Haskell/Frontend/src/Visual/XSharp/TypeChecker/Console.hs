{- | Text and the console in the type checker.

@System.Console@ is not declared in any source file. Its methods are known
to the compiler, and a call of one is checked here and rewritten into calls
of the runtime: the typed tree that leaves the type checker has no
@Console.Printf@ in it, only the conversions of its format, joined, and one
write. The stages after the type checker therefore need to know nothing of
formats, and a format that is wrong never reaches them.

The same holds for the two operations of the language on strings that need
the runtime: @+@, which joins two strings and writes a value that is not a
string as text first, and @==@ and @\\=@, which compare the characters of
two strings and not the places they are kept.

A runtime call is written in the typed tree as a call of a name whose
symbol is reserved for one function of the runtime catalog; see
'runtimeName'. No source name has such a symbol.
