{- | The types of literals and the range of constant expressions.

A literal takes its type from the place that receives it, and a constant
expression must fit the type it is stored in. Both are rules of
"Visual.XSharp.NumericSemantics" applied at a source position; the checker
of expressions calls them and adds what they report.
