{- | Classic enums: their members, their values and their rules.

A classic enum is a value type whose members are named integers of one
underlying type. Members are numbered from zero, a member without a written
value takes the value after that of the member before it, and two members
may have the same value. A written value is a constant integer expression:
integer literals and earlier members of the same enum, joined by the
arithmetic, shift and bitwise operators. Inside its own declaration the name
of a member stands for its number; that is where the numbers behind the names
are defined, and it is the only place where a member is a number. An enum is
a type of its own: its values are
compared with @==@ and @\\=@ and with nothing else, and there is no
conversion between an enum and an integer in either direction.

The checker reads the enums of a source set into a table before it checks
any body, so that a use may precede the declaration.
