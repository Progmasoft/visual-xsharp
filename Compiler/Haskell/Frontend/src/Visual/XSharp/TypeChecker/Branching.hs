{- | Typing rules of value blocks, @match@, and @guard@.

The rules need the checker for expressions and statements, which the main
type checker owns together with its template and loop context. They receive
it through 'BranchChecker', already applied to that context, so this module
states the rules of the branching forms without knowing how names, templates,
or loops are tracked.

{- | Check a block used as a value.

Its value is its final expression, written without a semicolon, and that
expression is typed in the context that receives the value. A block may
instead leave: with @return@ it leaves the enclosing function, with @break@
or @continue@ the enclosing loop, under the rules those statements have
anywhere else. A block that cannot complete normally produces no value and
needs no final expression, and a block whose final expression never
completes produces none either. Whether a block completes is a fact about
its control flow, kept apart from its type: 'doesNotComplete' answers it from
the typed tree, the annotation of such a block is @void@, and the form that
holds it takes its type from the blocks that do complete. A block that can
complete normally must end with its value.

A @return@ in such a block is checked against the declared return type of
the enclosing function like any other. Where that type is inferred, the
returns of the body are read from its typed tree afterwards, through
expressions as well ("Visual.XSharp.TypeChecker.Returns").
