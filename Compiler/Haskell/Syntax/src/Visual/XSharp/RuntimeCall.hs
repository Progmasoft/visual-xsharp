{- | The catalog of runtime calls.

A runtime call is an operation the compiler does not lower to instructions
but to a call of a function of the Visual X# runtime: joining two strings,
converting a number for output, writing to the console. Core and the stages
after it carry it as one operation whose first operand is an integer
literal, the identity of the function, and whose remaining operands are the
arguments.

This module is what the frontend knows about each function: its identity,
the types it takes and returns, and whether it does something that can be
observed. The native stages have the same table in
@Visual\/XSharp\/Core\/RuntimeCall.hpp@. The identities are part of the
artifact formats: a function is never renumbered, and a new one takes the
next free number. The tests of both sides pin every row.

The catalog stands in the syntax package because the type checker, which
chooses the function for a source construct, and Core, which verifies the
call, both need it and neither depends on the other.
