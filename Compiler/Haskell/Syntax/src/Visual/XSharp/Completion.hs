{- | Whether control can reach the end of a statement or an expression.

This is a fact about control flow and is kept apart from types. A block that
ends with @return@, an @if@ expression whose two blocks both leave, and a
call one of whose arguments is such an expression never produce a value, but
no type says so: the question is answered from the typed tree by the
functions of this module. The type checker uses them to decide what must
have a value, and the desugarer uses the same functions to lower what never
completes as statements alone, so that nothing is stored for a value that
does not exist.

The answers err on the side of completing: a call is assumed to return, and
a condition is assumed to be able to take either value unless it is the
literal @true@. Whether a @break@ or @continue@ has a loop to leave is a
separate rule of the type checker.

{- | Whether control can never reach the end of a block.

A statement cannot complete normally when it is a @return@, a @break@ or a
@continue@; an @if@ with an @else@ whose two blocks both cannot; a nested
block that cannot; a loop whose condition is the constant true, or absent in
a @for@, and that no @break@ leaves; a statement @match@ some arm of which
always accepts and all of whose arms cannot; or any statement an expression
of which is always evaluated and never completes. A block cannot complete
when one of its statements cannot, because the statements after that one are
never reached.

{- | Whether evaluating an expression never yields a value.

That is so when a part of it that is always evaluated never does, or when it
is a choice every branch of which leaves: an @if@ expression whose two
blocks do not complete, a block used as a value that cannot complete or
whose final expression does not, or a @match@ one arm of which always
accepts and no arm of which completes. An operand that is evaluated only
sometimes, such as the right operand of @&&@, decides nothing.
