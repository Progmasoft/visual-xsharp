{- | Warnings about source text that is valid but probably not what its
author meant.

A warning never changes what a program means and never rejects it. The only
warning today concerns the spelling of the removed decrement operator.
Visual X# has no decrement: @--@ starts a comment wherever it stands outside
a string. Text written for an earlier compiler, or by habit from another
language, may still say @count--;@ or @--count;@. Both are now a comment,
and the statement terminator after them is part of that comment, so the
program can keep compiling with a different meaning. This module points at
those two spellings.

{- | Warnings for one source text, in source order.

A text the lossless scanner rejects has no warnings: its lexical error is
reported by the lexer, and a warning about the same text would only repeat
it.

{- | Warn when a line comment has one of the two decrement spellings.

* Attached: the comment starts directly after a name, a closing parenthesis
  or a closing bracket, as in @count--;@.
* Leading: the comment text is a name directly after @--@, followed only by
  a statement terminator, as in @--count;@.

Documentation comments and long comments are never decrement spellings, and
a comment separated from the code by a space is an ordinary comment.
