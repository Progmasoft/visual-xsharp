{- | Which expressions the compiler takes to have an effect.

Evaluation is by need and effects are not: an expression that writes to the
console is evaluated where it stands. The source does not say which
expressions write, so the frontend infers it from the bodies of the methods
a program has; see "Visual.XSharp.Desugarer.Effects". These cases hold that
inference from both sides:

* it must find every write, however far down the calls it is, or a program
  would write later than it says, or not at all;
* it must not find writes that are not there, or a program without output
  would lose the evaluation by need it had.

Each program is checked twice: for what it writes, in the reference
evaluator before and after optimization, and for the shape of its Core,
where a flag named @$known@ marks a binding that was deferred and
@CoreMemoize@ an argument that was suspended.

Where the inference errs on purpose, the case says so and pins it, so that
making it more exact shows as a change here.
