{- | Names written through what declares them.

A declaration of a namespace may be named through the namespace:
@Demo.Program@ is @Program@ inside the namespace @Demo@. A static method may
be referred to through its type without being called: @Program::Log@ is the
method as a callable value, like the bare @Log@ inside @Program@. A selector
with a dot is not a reference: @Program.Log@ without a call is rejected.

Each program is run in the reference evaluator, before and after
optimization, and what it writes is compared with text written by hand. The
programs that must be rejected are held with the code of the diagnostic.
