{- | Tests for evaluation by need.

Visual X# computes a value when it is first needed and at most once, and
never computes a value that is not needed. The tests observe that through
the only things that tell a computed value from one that was not: a division
by zero, a call that never returns, and the number of steps a program takes.
The reference evaluator of "CoreInterpreter" gives no result for a division
by zero and for a program that exceeds its step budget, so a value computed
without need shows as a missing result.

The effects of a program are not lazy. A store into a variable happens where
it is written, whether or not the value around it is ever read, and a value
means what its variables held where it was bound, however late it is
computed. The tests pin both.

The expected values are written by hand.
