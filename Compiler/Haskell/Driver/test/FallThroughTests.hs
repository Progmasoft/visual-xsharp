{- | How a function ends when its body ends.

A function without a result may end without a @return@: reaching the end of
its body returns. A function with a result returns on every path, so the end
of its body is never reached, and the block that stands there is marked as
unreachable rather than given a value nobody wrote.

The two must not be confused. A function without a result whose last block
was marked unreachable had no meaning once it was called, and a native
program whose @Main@ ended that way stopped instead of ending.
