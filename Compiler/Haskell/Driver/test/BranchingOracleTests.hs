{- | Differential tests for the lowering of @match@.

A match over scalars means the same as a chain of @if@ statements that tests
the arms in order: the first arm whose literals equal the subjects and whose
guard holds supplies the result, and a guard is evaluated only when the
literals of its arm are equal. The @if@ chain is lowered by code that existed
before @match@ did and has its own tests, so it serves as the oracle here.

The tests generate families of arm lists from a fixed seed, write each family
once as a match and once as the chain, and require the two programs to return
the same value for every argument in a small domain, on the unoptimized and
on the optimized Core. Every guard also adds a distinct weight to a counter
that is part of the result, so a guard that runs when it should not, or does
not run when it should, changes the value even when the selected arm is the
same.
