{- | A small reference evaluator for scalar Core, used only by tests.

It executes Core statements directly, without CorePrep, the optimizer or the
native backend, so a test can state what a source program must compute and
check that against the Core the Desugarer produced and, separately, against
the Core the optimizer left. It is deliberately independent of both: it
shares no lowering or rewriting code with the compiler.

The subset is the one the tests need: integer and Boolean values, the
arithmetic, comparison, bitwise and logical primitives, expression-local
bindings, conditional expressions, direct calls of module functions,
closures, callables that remember their result, strings, the runtime calls
for text and the console, and all statement forms. What a program writes to
the console is kept and returned with its result. Integers are unbounded; a test that depends on overflow
belongs to the native execution tests instead. Anything outside the subset,
and any run that exceeds its step budget, yields 'Nothing' rather than a
guess.
