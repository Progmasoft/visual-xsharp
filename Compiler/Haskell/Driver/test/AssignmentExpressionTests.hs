{- | Vertical tests for assignments and increments used as values:
@target = value@, @target op= value@, @++target@, @target++@ and
@target--@ in operand position.

Core expressions never store into a local, so these source forms lower to
statements plus a store-free read. The shape tests pin that lowering. The
evaluation tests are the semantic oracle: each one states the value a source
program must compute under left-to-right evaluation and runs the reference
evaluator of "CoreInterpreter" on the Core the Desugarer produced and again
on the Core the optimizer left, so a lowering that reorders a read and a
store, or an optimization that does, fails with a wrong number.
