{- | Where the diagnostics of @match@, @if@ expressions, @guard@ and nested
blocks point, and that damaged spellings of those forms are always answered.

An editor underlines the range a diagnostic carries, so the tests pin the
start of every range: the arm that can never be selected and not the whole
match, the pattern that binds a duplicate name and not its arm. The
robustness tests feed the frontend every prefix of a program that uses the
new forms, and the same program with each token removed in turn. The parser
has loops of its own for subjects, arms and patterns; a damaged input must
end each of them with a diagnostic or a tree, never with a hang or an
exception. The last group pins how the forms behave in a template body and
on an @else if@ chain far longer than any test above the frontend used
before.
