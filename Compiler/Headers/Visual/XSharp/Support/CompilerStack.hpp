     * thread that compiles it. The stack a process starts with differs by
     * platform: one megabyte on Windows, eight on Linux and macOS, and half
     * a megabyte for secondary threads on macOS. A limit that is safe on
     * one of them would be either a crash on another or needlessly small
     * everywhere. The compiler therefore runs on a thread whose stack it
     * chooses itself, and the nesting limits of the frontend are stated
     * against this size.
     *
     * Only address space is reserved; pages are committed as they are
     * touched, so an ordinary program pays for the stack it uses.
