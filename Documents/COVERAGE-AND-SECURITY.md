# Code scanning and coverage

CodeQL and Codecov answer different questions. CodeQL analyzes supported source languages for potential defects and
security problems; Codecov collects lines executed by tests. Neither substitutes for component contract tests,
sanitizers, fuzzing, or review.

## CodeQL ownership

The [CodeQL workflow](../.github/workflows/codeql.yml) analyzes five supported surfaces independently:

| Language | Extraction |
| --- | --- |
| GitHub Actions | Workflow source, without a build |
| C/C++ | Project-owned source, without a build |
| Go | Manual builds of every command and internal package in helpers/ |
| Java/Kotlin | Manual Gradle compilation of ProjectSystem, Analyzer, Formatter, and Linter |
| JavaScript/TypeScript | Editor integration source, without a build |

The configuration excludes `third_party/` and generated build output. Haskell is not a CodeQL-supported language; its
compiler packages retain Cabal tests, HPC coverage, and ordinary review instead of a misleading empty CodeQL job. The
workflow runs for pushes, pull requests, and a weekly schedule. A successful scan means the configured analysis
completed, not that the code is free of vulnerabilities. Review alerts in the repository's code-scanning interface.

C and C++ are analysed without a build: the extractor reads the sources and guesses how they would be compiled, which
needs no LLVM on the runner and can analyse less than the repository has without saying so. The `c-cpp` job therefore
measures what it covered. It compares the native sources the repository owns under `Compiler/` and `Interactive/` with
the sources the CodeQL database holds, and fails below 95 percent. It also writes the extractor's own summary and
telemetry to the job summary, among them the includes it could not resolve; those figures have no floor yet.

## Dependency and additional quality analysis

[Renovate](../.github/renovate.json5) proposes version updates for GitHub Actions, Bazel module dependencies, all four
Gradle builds, the Go tooling module in `helpers/` and the VS Code extension. It looks once a week, takes a release a
week after it is published, opens one pull request for each kind of dependency, and rebases a pull request only when it
conflicts. It proposes reviewable pull requests; it does not auto-merge them. Cobra and its transitive dependencies
are version-pinned with module checksums. Cabal packages and pinned submodules need manual dependency review.

Dependabot no longer proposes version updates here, so that two bots do not open the same pull request. Its alerts
and its security updates stay enabled in the repository settings: a dependency with a known vulnerability is still
reported, and its fix is still proposed, by Dependabot. Neither bot replaces CodeQL.

[Codacy configuration](../.codacy.yml) excludes third-party and generated output while retaining project-owned
implementation, tests, and CI. Codacy's GitHub application must be connected to the Progmasoft organization and this
repository added in Codacy before its hosted analysis runs. No Codacy API token is needed for hosted static analysis;
coverage remains with Codecov rather than being uploaded twice. Until the first Codacy analysis is visible, the
configuration is only prepared, not a verified scan.

## Codecov ownership

Coverage uploads carry separate flags so one component's result cannot be mistaken for another's:

| Flag | Producer | Report |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `haskell-frontend` | Instrumented Cabal compiler tests | HPC converted to LCOV |
| `native-cpp` | The native C++/Interactive suites on macOS | Clang source-based LCOV |
| `kotlin-project-system` | ProjectSystem Gradle tests | JaCoCo XML |
| `kotlin-analyzer` | Analyzer Gradle tests | JaCoCo XML |
| `kotlin-formatter` | Formatter Gradle tests | JaCoCo XML |
| `kotlin-linter` | Linter Gradle tests | JaCoCo XML |
| `go-tools` | All helper command and internal package tests | Go cover profiles |

The [Haskell coverage workflow](../.github/workflows/haskell-coverage.yml) still owns HPC conversion. The
[component coverage workflow](../.github/workflows/coverage.yml) owns the remaining reports. Both upload through
Codecov's GitHub OIDC path without a repository token. The native report is generated from the same native suite matrix as
`develop test`; it does not count a binary merely because it built. JaCoCo XML is generated after running the owning
tests, and Go profiles cover every package in the helper module.

To reproduce a Kotlin report locally, run `gradle -p ProjectSystem test jacocoTestReport` (or replace the directory with
Analyzer, Formatter, or Linter). For native macOS coverage, run
`go run ./helpers/cmd/develop test -- --copt=-fprofile-instr-generate --copt=-fcoverage-mapping
--linkopt=-fprofile-instr-generate` with `LLVM_PROFILE_FILE` set to a writable path containing
`%p-%m`, then merge the raw profiles with `llvm-profdata` and export LCOV with `llvm-cov`. The CI workflow is the
authoritative command sequence. Coverage percentages measure the exercised files, not language-spec completeness or
correctness. A missing report or failed upload is a failing CI job, never zero coverage or an implicit pass.
