# Repository layout

## Buildable components

```text
Compiler/     Native vxs driver, public headers, modular C++20 implementation, Haskell packages, and build support
xslang/       Retiring Rust reference implementation; not a production build dependency
ProjectSystem/ Kotlin project evaluator, VXDC, and Visual.XSharp.kts DSL
Spec/         Public language-design example suites
third_party/  Pinned source dependencies
```

Compiler-owned public headers live physically under `Compiler/Headers/Visual/XSharp/`. Bazel removes the physical
`Compiler/Headers` prefix from consumers, so the stable include spelling remains `Visual/XSharp/...`.
Tests and fixtures live below their owning component rather than in a root bucket. Retained C23 and superseded LIL
headers are isolated below `Compiler/Legacy/Headers/Visual/XSharp/Legacy/`; current compiler code must not include them.

## Compiler tree

The compiler is decomposed by ownership rather than stored in one `src` directory:

```text
Compiler/
├── Backend/LLVM/          verified Xmm-to-LLVM lowering and target emission
├── Build/Bazel/           toolchain discovery and narrow build support
├── Cli/
│   ├── Arguments/         typed command/option schema
│   └── Commands/          command dispatch
├── Codegen/Xpp/           Xpp lowering, optimization, and verification
├── Codegen/Xmm/           Xmm lowering, optimization, and verification
├── Core/                  native Core reader/verifier and CorePrep adapter
├── Driver/                connected Core-to-native coordination
├── Haskell/
│   ├── Syntax/            tokens and AST vocabulary
│   ├── Frontend/          Lexer through Desugarer
│   ├── Core/              Core/CorePrep, optimization, verification, codecs
│   └── Driver/            source loading and private frontend process
├── Headers/Visual/XSharp/ public/native interface headers
├── Linker/                typed LLD execution
├── Legacy/                isolated retained C23/LIL implementation, headers, and tests
└── ProjectSystem/Bridge/  native-to-Kotlin project boundary
```

The directory names are architectural seams even though `vxs` is one executable. Splitting them does not create separately
installed frontend/backend tools.

### Allowed dependency direction

```text
Cli -> Commands -> Project bridge / Driver / Linker
Driver -> Core -> Xpp -> Xmm -> LLVM backend
Haskell Driver -> Frontend -> Syntax
Haskell Driver -> Core
Project bridge -> evaluated Kotlin plan
```

Reverse dependencies are avoided. LLVM does not call the CLI; Core does not depend on Xpp; Syntax does not depend on the
project evaluator; public headers do not expose private LLVM handles. Shared code belongs in the narrowest package that does
not reverse this direction.

The ecosystem tools have independent ownership and build systems:

```text
Analyzer/         Haskell LSP and Kotlin configuration DSL
Formatter/        Haskell vfmt executable and Kotlin configuration DSL
Linter/           Haskell vlint executable and Kotlin configuration DSL
```

These canonical projects replace the retired `xs-analyzer`, `xsfmt`, and `xstidy` prototypes. Their Haskell components use
Cabal, their Kotlin configuration layers use Gradle with an external JRE 25 and
Kotlin Script Runner, and the Visual Analyzer editor integrations additionally use their platform-specific build systems.

Their first compiler-connected layer is intentionally narrow: Visual Analyzer exposes syntax, semantic, and full frontend
analysis without a standalone executable; `vfmt` performs parser-gated physical source normalization; and `vlint` combines
semantic compiler diagnostics with independently actionable source-hygiene checks. Kotlin configuration and editor hosts
remain separate ownership layers and are not represented by placeholder implementations.

The analyzer, formatter, and linter Kotlin modules currently provide typed scopes, defaults, validation, and immutable
snapshots. Their future script evaluators remain a separate integration layer.

Visual Formatter and Visual Linter use independent release lines rather than inheriting the compiler version. Analyzer,
Formatter, and Linter also have separate CI workflows so each project can evolve without coupling its validation gates to
the others.

## Build ownership

Bazel owns top-level native orchestration. `scripts/develop.go` is a thin, portable user interface over that graph for
host discovery, suite execution, and sanitizers; it defines no targets or dependency edges of its own. Language-specific CI
jobs call Cabal and Gradle directly, and the repository carries neither CMake configuration nor a second build graph such as
`just`.

## Nested repositories

The website and IDE are maintained as separate repositories beneath the local working directory. They are not part of the
root Git index or root Bazel graph.

## Generated directories

Build products, Cargo targets, Cabal `dist-newstyle`, Gradle output, website distribution files, and local service state are
generated or local-only data and are not source ownership boundaries.

Typical disposable paths include `bazel-*`, `dist-newstyle`, `.gradle`, `build`, `target`, website package-manager output,
IDE caches, and local service databases. Their presence must not influence source discovery, tests, release content, or
documentation claims.

## Project-system ownership

`ProjectSystem/` owns `Visual.XSharp.kts`, plugin loading, immutable plan construction, dependency declarations, lockfile
persistence, and VXDC. `Compiler/ProjectSystem/Bridge/` is only the native transport/launch boundary. Keeping these apart
prevents the C++ driver from becoming a second implementation of Kotlin validation rules.

The JVM package root is `com.progmasoft.visual.xsharp.project`. Legacy `org.progmasoft` or `xs` package segments are not used
for renewed project-system code. JVM support does not implement Xmm readers/writers; native IR ownership remains C++20.

## Specification ownership

`Spec/` is grouped by language responsibility:

```text
Spec/
├── Language/              syntax and core language behavior
├── StandardLibrary/       System surfaces and library contracts
├── Libraries/Databases/   provider and database APIs
└── Interop/               FFI and inline assembly boundaries
```

Each `.vxs` file is a topic suite of independent examples. Its directory structure improves navigation and does not impose a
namespace-to-file mapping on the compiler.

## Repository boundaries

The root index contains compiler, project system, ecosystem tools, specification, tests, shared headers, and scripts. Local
website, IDE, and service directories may be nested beneath the checkout while remaining separate repositories or ignored
deployment state. A root change must not assume that committing the root automatically commits or deploys those children.

Go is the only language used for repository automation scripts. Portable helpers live directly under `scripts/`; their
filenames state their purpose instead of introducing one-child language directories. Shell, PowerShell, Java source-file,
and mixed-language script implementations are not added. Scripts do not become a parallel build orchestrator. Normal
repository commits and pushes use `githelper.go`, while Bazel, Cabal, and Gradle retain build ownership.

CMake may still appear as a project-system DSL plugin. That plugin integrates user projects with CMake; it is not the build
system for the Visual X# compiler and therefore does not contradict Bazel ownership.

## Placement checklist

Before adding a directory or target, ask:

1. Which representation or user-facing product owns the behavior?
2. Which language is authoritative for that stage?
3. Does the new dependency follow the allowed direction?
4. Is this shipped source, a test, build support, generated output, or local deployment state?
5. Can the file remain under 1500 lines through responsibility-based decomposition?
6. Does a public header need the stable `Visual/XSharp/...` include spelling?
7. Would the placement accidentally revive a retired compiler route or prototype name?

The goal is a monorepo made of coherent subprojects, not a flat directory and not several competing implementations of the
same semantic stage.
